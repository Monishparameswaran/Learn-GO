Create login validation program that takes 2 option from the user , 
     1.sign up
     2.login
 if user press 1 ,they should be able to enter new email id and password, as a programmer you have to store that in the database
 if user press 2 , they should be able to enter their account details such as email and password, you have to verify that with details in
 database and say login successful , if password not matches it should tell invalid password, if email doesnt even exist tell "user not exist"
 and redirect them to sign in process..
